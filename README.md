## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App 1: LinkedIn 
    - Easy to navigate job board and streamlines process of applying with profile 
    - Indicates what factors would boost your profile engagement 

App 2: GrubHub 
    - Has cuisines to filter from & options to filter by distance
    - Ability to reorder the same order I have placed in the past 

App 3: Uber 
    - Ability to share your ride with family / friends (safety)
    - Rating system for both the passenger and the driver 

App Idea: 

A social media application to challenge your friends. Friends can make a challenge / bet, and other friends can either match the challenge or bet them that they can't do it. For example, do 20 push-ups can be a challenge made, and the loser must complete something set in the app. 

## Notes

The primary challenge that I encountered was understanding what the IBAction actually 
does and the use of it.
